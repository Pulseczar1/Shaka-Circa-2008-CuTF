I'm not providing a script, at this time, for automatically installing these files. It's not that many files to copy,
manually, and doing it manually ensures that you know what you are blowing away and not blowing away. The directory
structure is provided here to make it clear where files go. Treat the directory this readme file is in as the Quake
directory.
